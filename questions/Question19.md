### **Description**
You are building a reminder application that sends notifications at specified times. Write a function that takes an array of reminder times (in milliseconds) and a current time, and returns an array of reminders that are due (i.e., times less than or equal to the current time). This will help in notifying users of tasks that need immediate attention.

### **Hint**
![Hint](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hint:-blue)
Filter the array of reminders based on the current time.

### **Expected Output**
![Output](https://img.shields.io/badge/Output:-blue)
The function `getDueReminders([1628257325000, 1628260925000], 1628257325000)` should return `[1628257325000]`.
