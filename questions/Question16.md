### **Description**
You are creating a contact list application where users can search for contacts by name. Write a function that takes an array of contact objects, each with a name and phoneNumber property, and a search term. The function should return an array of contacts whose names include the search term. This will allow users to quickly find and retrieve contact information.

### **Hint**
![Hint](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hint:-blue)
Use the `includes` method to check if the contact's name contains the search term.

### **Expected Output**
![Output](https://img.shields.io/badge/Output:-blue)
The function `searchContacts([{ name: 'Alice', phoneNumber: '1234567890' }, { name: 'Bob', phoneNumber: '0987654321' }], 'Ali')` should return `[{ name: 'Alice', phoneNumber: '1234567890' }]`.
