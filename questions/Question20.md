### **Description**
You are creating a student attendance system. Write a function that takes an array of student objects, each with a name and attendance property, and returns the names of students who have perfect attendance (i.e., attendance is 100%). This will help in identifying and rewarding students who have maintained perfect attendance.

### **Hint**

Filter the array of students based on the attendance property.

### **Expected Output**
![Output](https://img.shields.io/badge/Output:-blue)
The function `getPerfectAttendance([{ name: 'Alice', attendance: 100 }, { name: 'Bob', attendance: 90 }])` should return `['Alice']`.
