### **Description**
You are developing a task management system. Write a function that takes an array of `task objects`, each with a `due date` and a `status` (completed or not), and returns an array of tasks that are `overdue` (i.e., have a `due date` before today and are not completed).

### **Hint**

Use `date comparisons` and array methods to filter overdue tasks.

### **Expected Output**
